# Guess My Number Game

Welcome to the "Guess My Number" game application! Test your guessing skills and try to guess the random number between 1 and 20 that the application has chosen.

## Gameplay

In the "Guess My Number" game, you are challenged to guess the randomly selected number within the range of 1 to 20. Here's how the gameplay works:

1. The application secretly selects a random number.
2. You, as the player, input your guess.
3. If your guess is significantly lower than the selected number, you'll receive a hint to try a higher number.
4. If your guess is significantly higher than the selected number, you'll be advised to try a lower number.
5. If your guess is within 1 unit of the selected number, you'll be informed that you're very close to the target.

## Features

- **Scoring and Highscore**:
  - At the beginning of the game, your score starts at 20.
  - Each time you make a guess, your score decreases by 1.
  - The lower your score, the better your performance.
  - If you correctly guess the number, your score reflects the number of attempts it took to get it right.
  - The highscore is recorded in the local storage and represents your best performance in terms of the lowest score achieved.
